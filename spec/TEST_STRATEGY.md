# Test Strategy

## Testing pyramid
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for external adapters
- E2E tests for critical flows

## TDD loop
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimal code
3. Refactor
4. Repeat

## Quality gates
- Unit test pass required for PR
- Integration test pass required for merge
- E2E pass required for QA sign-off
